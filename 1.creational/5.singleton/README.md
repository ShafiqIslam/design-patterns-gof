# Singleton Pattern

## Definition

The singleton pattern is one of the simplest design patterns. Sometimes we need to have only one instance of our class for example a single DB connection shared by multiple objects as creating a separate DB connection for every object may be costly. Similarly, there can be a single configuration manager or error manager in an application that handles all problems instead of creating multiple managers.

## How to Implement

1. Add a private static field to the class for storing the singleton instance.
2. Declare a public static creation method for getting the singleton instance.
3. Implement “lazy initialization” inside the static method. It should create a new object on its first call and put it into the static field. The method should always return that instance on all subsequent calls.
4. Make the constructor of the class private. The static method of the class will still be able to call the constructor, but not the other objects.
5. Go over the client code and replace all direct calls to the singleton’s constructor with calls to its static creation method.
